[How to speed up boot time if run headless?](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=25777&sid=d081bc4d053c45818371c51b44ea8cad) – there are claims of boot times in the sub 10 second range, Gordon Hollingsworth (who might know) says:

>The fastest way to boot is to build yourself an initird ramdisk. That way you can be up in 5 seconds. Check out berryboot as an example of how quick it is to boot linux
